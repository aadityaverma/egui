## Project Overview & Architecture

`egui` is a Rust-based immediate mode GUI library structured as a workspace with multiple crates. Based on `ARCHITECTURE.md`, the key crates are:

*   **`egui`**: The core GUI library.
*   **`emath`**: A 2D math library.
*   **`epaint`**: A 2D painting library.
*   **`eframe`**: The official framework for running `egui` on web and native.
*   **`egui_demo_app` & `egui_demo_lib`**: The web demo application and its core logic.

This architecture separates concerns and allows for modular development.

## Development Strategy & Project Management

My approach to this project will be guided by Rust best practices for large projects, including:

*   **Understanding the Workspace:** I will treat the project as a cohesive workspace, being mindful of the dependencies and interactions between crates.
*   **Phased Approach:** I will follow a three-phase plan: Understanding, Experimentation, and Contribution.
*   **Leveraging Tooling:** I will use `cargo` and other tools as needed for building, testing, and dependency management.

## Phase 1: Understanding the Ecosystem (The "Init" Process)

**Objective:** Gain a deep understanding of the `egui` ecosystem, its architecture, and idiomatic usage.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Web Demo Deep Dive:**
    *   Build and run the `web_demo` locally using the provided scripts (`scripts/build_demo_web.sh` and `scripts/start_server.sh`).
    *   Trace the code flow from the `egui_demo_app` (the application layer) through `egui_demo_lib` (the UI code) to `eframe` (the application runner) and finally to the core `egui` library.
    *   Analyze `index.html` to understand the wasm initialization, error handling, and panic checking mechanisms.
    *   Analyze `multiple_apps.html` to understand how to manage multiple `egui` instances on a single web page.
    *   Examine `egui_demo_app.js` to understand the JavaScript-Rust interop layer generated by `wasm-bindgen`.

2.  **API and Idioms:**
    *   Review the official `egui` documentation and the Rust API design guidelines to understand the public API and its intended usage.
    *   Study the examples in the `examples/` directory to learn idiomatic `egui` patterns.

3.  **Build and Test Process:**
    *   Familiarize myself with the build and testing workflows by examining the scripts in the `scripts/` directory and the test configurations in the `tests/` directory.

## Phase 2: Experimentation & Prototyping

**Objective:** Apply my understanding to make changes and build new components.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Modify the Demo:**
    *   Add a new widget or panel to the `egui_demo_lib` to see the changes reflected in the web demo. This will test my understanding of the UI code and the project's compilation process.

2.  **Create a New Example:**
    *   Create a new, standalone example in the `examples/` directory that uses `eframe` to build a simple application. This will demonstrate my ability to use the framework from scratch.

3.  **Multi-App Experimentation:**
    *   Create a new HTML file that hosts two different `egui` applications (or two instances of the same application) side-by-side. This will demonstrate a deeper understanding of the `eframe` web integration.

4.  **WebAssembly (WASM) Exploration:**
    *   Consult Rust WebAssembly tutorials to get a deeper understanding of the `wasm-bindgen` tool and the process of compiling Rust to WASM for the web.
    *   Study the `WebHandle` class in `egui_demo_app.js` to understand how to control the `egui` application from JavaScript.

5.  **"UI Widgets" Window:**
    *   Created a new "UI Widgets" window in `egui_demo_lib` that showcases a comprehensive collection of `egui` widgets and features.
    *   The window is inspired by existing components like the Widget Gallery, Code Editor, and various other demos.
    *   It includes sections for:
        *   Basic Widgets
        *   Text Editing with Undo/Redo
        *   Panels and Layouts (including `StripBuilder`)
        *   Advanced Scrolling
        *   Popups, Modals, and Tooltips
        *   Interactive Elements (Drag and Drop, Interactive Container, Scene)
        *   Code Editor with Syntax Highlighting

## Phase 3: Contribution

**Objective:** Contribute back to the `egui` project.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Identify Opportunities:**
    *   Look for issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted" on the project's GitHub repository.
    *   Analyze the codebase for potential improvements in documentation, examples, or performance.

2.  **Follow Contribution Guidelines:**
    *   Adhere to the contribution guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
    *   Write clean, idiomatic, and well-tested Rust code.
